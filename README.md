# CiperLink: Advanced Zero-Knowledge Proof Authentication System
Welcome to CiperLink, an innovative solution harnessing the power of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) to offer a cutting-edge authentication system. This project is designed for developers looking to integrate heightened security without compromising on user privacy. CiperLink enables secure authentication by allowing users to prove their credentials without exposing any sensitive information.

### Working Deployment 
[CiperLink](https://ciperlink.puneetbajaj.com)


### Key Features:
Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Utilize ZKP to ensure that user data remains completely private. Users can authenticate securely without ever revealing their secret information.
Robust Security Framework: Built with the latest cryptographic protocols to ensure that security is paramount and data integrity is maintained throughout the process.
Scalable and Efficient: Designed to handle high volumes of authentication requests with minimal latency, making it suitable for enterprise-level applications.
Open-Source: CiperLink is open-source, allowing developers to contribute to and review the underlying code, fostering a community-driven approach to secure authentication.
Comprehensive Documentation: Comes with detailed documentation and examples, making it easy for developers to implement and customize according to their needs.

### Technologies Used:
##### SnarkJS : The main cryptographic JS library supporting all the proof and verification functions for the application
##### Node.js: For creating a scalable backend capable of handling authentication logic and database interactions.
##### MongoDB: As a NoSQL database to store user data and authentication tokens securely.
##### Google Cloud Functions: Leveraged for deploying serverless functions that handle authentication requests, ensuring quick scalability and reduced server costs.
##### React: Used on the frontend to build a responsive and interactive user interface.
##### Next.js: A React framework that provides server-side rendering to improve SEO and boost performance.
##### Mongoose: To manage relationships between data, provide schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.
